    "   - All tasks in a stage can run in parallel\n",
    "   - Example: Stage 1 (read + filter), Stage 2 (groupBy + aggregate)\n",

    "   - Tasks are the smallest unit of execution\n",
    "   - Example: Process partition 1 of 200\n",

    "4. **Partition** - An atomic chunk of data (logical division) stored on a node\n",

    "**Note for Practice**: Each operation should be practiced with the sample data defined at the beginning of this notebook. Key takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Transformations are lazy** - operations like select, filter, groupBy don't execute until an action is called\n",
    "2. **Actions trigger execution** - show(), collect(), count() cause immediate computation\n",
    "3. **Immutability** - Every transformation creates a new DataFrame\n",
    "4. **filter() and where() are equivalent** - Both filter rows, interchangeable\n",
    "5. **Cache strategically** - Only cache DataFrames used multiple times after expensive operations\n",
    "6. **DataFrames > RDDs** - Better optimization through Catalyst\n",
    "7. **SQL integration** - Can use SQL queries on DataFrames via createOrReplaceTempView()\n",
    "8. **UDF registration** - `spark.udf.register('name', lambda x: x * 2)` for SQL, or use `udf()` decorator for DataFrame API"
